<h1>Tips</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>How to use cross-domain mock web services?</strong></p>

<p>In the command line you have the option to specify the folder name where all the web services data are stored. In the meantime all the http requests that have the URLs starting with this folder name will be considered as web service calls. For example, by default this folder is named as <strong><em>ws</em></strong>, if you have a file called data.json and another called error.json under the same <strong><em>ws</em></strong> folder, the <strong>GET</strong> request of http://localhost:3000/ws/data.json will have data.json returned as the payload for your ajax success callback, and the one of http://localhost:3000/ws/data.json?error=error.json will simulate the error situation and return error.json as payload for your ajax error callback. You can name these files howerever you want. You just need to make sure that the pairing data file and error file should stay under the same folder and the error file should be specified as the value of key <strong><em>error</em></strong> in the query.</p>

<p>In the case of <strong>POST</strong> request, the principle is the same. The only difference is that the data.json file will mean the post result, and the error file should be put into the data body of request, as error=error.json, as opposed to in the query.</p>

<p>For an example, please reference the <a href="https://github.com/marty-wang/NServe/blob/master/samples/ajax.html"><strong>ajax.html</strong></a> in the <strong>samples</strong> folder.</p>

<p>Again, by default it defaults to <strong><em>ws</em></strong> folder for all the web services. But you can change to another folder in the command line with the option <strong>-w</strong> or <strong>--webservice-folder</strong>, and refer to that folder under the root where <strong><em>nserve</em></strong> is running.</p>

<p>Also you have the ability to "slow down" the web services by using th option <strong>-D</strong> or <strong>--webservice-delay</strong>. You want to do that in the situation where you want to test your loader, for example.</p></li>
